The first thing I aimed for was to create an **assistant for League of Legends**, a game I frequent. There are plenty of applications that do the same, but **the focus was on going through the entire process and learning whatever was needed along the way.**\r\n\r\n# To understand the application, a bit of context about the game is needed\r\n\r\n![Image of league of legends](league-of-legends.jpg)\r\n[League of Legends](https://www.leagueoflegends.com/es-es/) is a 5vs5 multiplayer game, where each player controls one of over 150 characters.\r\nThe objective of the game is to destroy the enemy base.\r\n\r\nThe vast amount of content in the game, combined with the frequency of patches that modify the power level of the characters, makes it very difficult to stay up-to-date on which champion is stronger, which ones are not advisable to play, etc.\r\n\r\n---\r\n# App's objective\r\n![App image 2](img6.png)\r\n\r\nThe goal for the application was twofold. On one hand, it was supposed to provide **reliable statistics** about the current state of the characters in terms of which are stronger/weaker, as well as the correct equipment for each one.\r\nOn the other hand, it should also **provide assistance during the game** and character selection, making recommendations, **interacting directly with the game** and **providing information about allied and rival players**.\r\n\r\n---\r\n# Architecture and technologies\r\n![App image 3](img10.png)\r\n\r\nThe technologies used were **Python** for the backend, and **JavaScript** for the frontend. Python makes it easy to assemble an API using the **Django** library and also facilitates the generation of statistics thanks to the **Pandas** library.\r\n\r\nThe architecture will be broken down in several blogs, where I will explain how the [RiotGames API](https://developer.riotgames.com/docs/lol) works and how I obtained the statistics and interacted later from the frontend with the game Launcher, as well as some algorithms I developed along the way.\r\n\r\nIn a nutshell, the backend uses **Celery** to obtain information about players' matches (which is stored in **PostgreSQL**), prioritizing those players in a high league as they are the ones who play best and therefore are the most reliable source of information.\r\n\r\nBased on these matches, a series of statistics are made for each character (which are calculated with **Pandas** and stored in **MongoDB** due to the complexity of the documents), these statistics are requested from the frontend using a **Django** API. The frontend (**Electron + ReactJS**) uses these statistics to make recommendations, and obtains real-time information about the ongoing match through a WebSocket that connects the app with the game process, which in turn allows it to interact with it, **automating actions** such as selecting equipment, position, accepting match, etc.\r\n\r\n---\r\n# Development Details\r\nThe application can be downloaded and installed on Windows, the app code and installer are available on Github, accessible via the following links:\r\n[Frontend](https://github.com/fabran99/LolHelperFrontend) and [Backend](https://github.com/fabran99/LolStatisticsBackend)\r\n\r\nI will be adding links to the blogs where I write about the app's architecture and the various algorithms I used during the development.\r\n\r\n[1- Backend Architecture](/arquitecture-lol-app/)\r\n\r\n[2- Frontend with Electron and ReactJS](/frontend-lol-app/)\r\n","html":"<h2><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 590px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/af91051f1ac3254778715ff6b260308b/2bef9/img1.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 62.83783783783784%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"App image 1\"\n        title=\"App image 1\"\n        src=\"/static/af91051f1ac3254778715ff6b260308b/fcda8/img1.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/af91051f1ac3254778715ff6b260308b/12f09/img1.png 148w,\n/static/af91051f1ac3254778715ff6b260308b/e4a3f/img1.png 295w,\n/static/af91051f1ac3254778715ff6b260308b/fcda8/img1.png 590w,\n/static/af91051f1ac3254778715ff6b260308b/efc66/img1.png 885w,\n/static/af91051f1ac3254778715ff6b260308b/2bef9/img1.png 1024w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></h2>\n<p>When the pandemic hit, I set out to build a <strong>slightly more complex system than usual</strong> as a personal project.
